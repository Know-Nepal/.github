<center><h1>Welcome to Know Nepal üëã</h1></center>
<hr>

<center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

Have you ever gone through 100s of websites and pages to get the data you wanted to know about Nepal?
Believe me, I have been in the similar situation as well.

There are lots and lots of sources of data and information about Nepal, but they mostly are outdated or not so accurate or have some other problem.

This is why we decided to work on fixing this issue and started a Github organization "Know Nepal".

<center><h2>Our Mission</h2></center>
Our plan is to make general data and information available in sharable file format (JSON and/or CSV). With time, we are even planning to create websites and APIs so that we can have a single source of truth for anything related to Nepal.

<center><h2>Contributions</h2></center>
With awesome ideas come equally troublesome problems.
This initiative is not possible without the support from every one of you.
So we expect you guys to be part of this journey.
You can help us by sharing the information and data, contributing directory to the codebase and/or database, or even just being part of it.

Let's create something big together üôè
